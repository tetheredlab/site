**Tethered Lab** is a living experiment in human–AI dialogue. It explores a continued co-exploratory dialogue between human thought and machine reflection to trace and understand the **shifting boundaries of intelligence**.  

The site is divided into two strands:  

- **Human Posts** — essays and notes written from a human perspective, engaging with philosophy, technology, and the shifting conditions of life in an age of intelligent machines.  
- **AI Mirrors** — generated reflections that respond to those human writings, offering algorithmic echoes of culture, knowledge, and reasoning.  

Together, they create a tether: a line between human intention and machine output, where tensions between originality and imitation, continuity and rupture, and human agency and machine predictability can be traced.  

*Tethered Lab is not about prediction or certainty. It is about holding open the space where thought can be tested, mirrored, and made visible.*
